Feature: Broadcast brick

  A Broadcast brick should send a message and When scripts should react to it.

  Background:
    Given I have a Program
    And this program has an Object 'Object'

  Scenario: A Broadcast brick sends a message in a program with one When script
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'hello' brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the Start script.
      """
    Given 'Object' has a When 'hello' script
    And this script has a Wait 100 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the When 'hello' script.
      """
    When I start the program
    And I wait until the program has stopped
    Then I should see the printed output
      """
      I am the Start script.
      I am the When 'hello' script.
      """

  Scenario: A Broadcast brick sends a message in a program with two When scripts
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'hello' brick
    And this script has a Wait 200 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the Start script.
      """
    Given 'Object' has a When 'hello' script
    And this script has a Wait 100 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the first When 'hello' script.
      """
    Given 'Object' has a When 'hello' script
    And this script has a Wait 300 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the second When 'hello' script.
      """
    When I start the program
    And I wait until the program has stopped
    Then I should see the printed output
      """
      I am the first When 'hello' script.
      I am the Start script.
      I am the second When 'hello' script.
      """

  Scenario: Two When scripts simulate a forever loop
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'message1' brick
    Given 'Object' has a When 'message1' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'm1'
    And this script has a Wait 2 second brick
    And this script has a Broadcast 'message2' brick
    Given 'Object' has a When 'message2' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'm2'
    And this script has a Wait 2 second brick
    And this script has a Broadcast 'message1' brick
    When I start the program
    And I wait for 3100 milliseconds
    Then I should see the printed output 'm1m2m1'

  Scenario: Deadlock with BroadcastWait bricks
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'message1' brick
    Given 'Object' has a When 'message1' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'm1'
    And this script has a Wait 2 second brick
    And this script has a BroadcastWait 'message2' brick
    Given 'Object' has a When 'message2' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'm2'
    And this script has a Wait 2 second brick
    And this script has a BroadcastWait 'message1' brick
    When I start the program
    And I wait for 10000 milliseconds
    Then I should see the printed output 'm1m2'
