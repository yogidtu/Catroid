  A When script should be restarted when the message is broadcast again while the script is still running.

  Background:
    Given I have a Program
    And this program has an Object 'Object'

  Scenario: A program with two start scripts and one When script
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'hello' brick
    Given 'Object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Wait 100 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Broadcast 'hello' brick
    Given 'Object' has a When 'hello' script
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """
      I am the When 'hello' script (1).
      """
    And this script has a Wait 300 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with
      """

      I am the When 'hello' script (1).
      I am the When 'hello' script (1).
      I am the When 'hello' script (2).
      I am the When 'hello' script (3).
